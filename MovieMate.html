                        <strong>MovieMate</strong> is a full-stack web application designed for movie enthusiasts to
                        explore
                        and
                        manage
                        their favorite films. The project aimed to build both the server-side and client-side components
                        of the application, providing users with a seamless experience to access, save, and curate lists
                        of movies based on various attributes such as genre, director, and individual preferences.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Goal:</strong> The primary goal was to create a user-friendly platform where users can
                        interact with a dynamic movie database, register for personalized accounts, and save favorite
                        movies.

                        <strong>My Role:</strong> I acted as the sole developer, taking charge of both backend and
                        frontend
                        development,
                        as well as managing the database. I used my full-stack JavaScript skills to build the API,
                        design
                        the user interface, and ensure smooth communication between the client and the server.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The foundation of MovieMate's backend was built using
                        Node.js and Express,
                        where I designed a RESTful API to interact with a MongoDB database. This API provided endpoints
                        to
                        handle CRUD operations, including retrieving movies, registering users, and managing favorite
                        lists.
                        <br>
                        Setting up proper authentication using JWT, was initially challenging. Integrating secure
                        token-based
                        authentication was tricky due to session management across multiple
                        views, but I was able to resolve it through careful middleware configuration. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>
                        Frontend Development
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The client-side was developed using React to create a single-page application (SPA).
                        The application was structured into multiple views for
                        logging in, signing up, viewing a list of movies and movie details, and managing profiles.
                        Different
                        views are divided into
                        reusable components, to allow for better maintainability. <br>
                        One key challenge was managing state across different views, especially
                        when handling
                        user login and dynamic movie lists. To solve this, I used React Router for seamless page
                        transitions. To
                        ensure the state of favorites is properly synchronized across multiple views I created a custom
                        hook
                        and global states. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Database and Business Logic</h2>
                    <p>
                        MongoDB served as the NoSQL database, where I designed the schema
                        to handle movie
                        information and user data. I used Mongoose
                        models to simplify queries and validations. During database setup, data validation was crucial
                        to
                        ensure that only
                        correct information was saved.

                    The end result was a responsive and fully functional web application that met the original
                    objectives. <br>
                    <br>
                    The initial problem of providing movie enthusiasts with a platform to
                    discover and manage movie information was successfully solved with MovieMate. The final product
                    matched
                    the
                    original vision, though I encountered challenges along the way, especially with user authentication
                    and state management. These challenges taught me valuable lessons in debugging complex
                    authentication
                    flows
                    and managing state in React apps. <br>
                    <br>
                    I am most proud of the app's intuitive design and its ability to provide users with a seamless
                    experience across different devices. I hope users feel empowered to discover new films, save their
                    favorites, and share their recommendations.
